Get the cancer data in our study here: https://files.catbox.moe/nmj4ex.xlsb  
Get the normal data in our study here: https://files.catbox.moe/33iorg.xlsb  
These should be named cancer.xlsb for the first one, and normal.xlsb for the second one.  
  
The data sources are here for cancer: https://www.linkedomics.org/data_download/TCGA-LUSC/  
The data sources are here for normal: https://www.gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression  
  
Make sure you have Python 3.13.2 for optimal compatibility, and use Windows OS.  
First, create a virtual environment:  
`python -m venv .venv`  
`.venv/scripts/activate`  
`pip install numpy matplotlib pandas networkx scipy openpyxl pyxlsb`
